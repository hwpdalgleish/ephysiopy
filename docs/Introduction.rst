Introduction

What is ephysiopy?
------------------

A collection of tools for analysing electrophysiology data recorded with either the openephys or Axona recording
systems.

Rationale
---------

Analysis using Axona's Tint cluster cutting program or phy/ phy2 (openephys) is great but limited. This extends that functionality.

Installation
------------

ephysiopy requires python3.6 or greater. The easiest way to install is using pip:

``python3 -m pip install ephysiopy``

or,

``pip3 install ephysiopy``

Or similar. There are dependencies (see requirements.txt) but pip should take care of this. I haven't yet tried this in a virtual environment like conda or similar but a quick google shows it should be pretty easy. Let me know if it isn't.

Documentation
-------------

You're looking at it but for completeness it is at `https://ephysiopy.readthedocs.io/ <https://ephysiopy.readthedocs.io/>`_
